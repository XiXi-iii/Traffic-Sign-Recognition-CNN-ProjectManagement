# Traffic Sign Recognition System Using CNN - Project Management Demo

## Project Description
This repository contains the CNN-based Traffic Sign Recognition System originally developed as a technical prototype in a previous academic exercise. It is reused here to demonstrate the application of AI project management processes including planning, execution, monitoring, and control.

The primary focus of this project is on managing the AI development lifecycle rather than algorithm innovation.

## Dataset

This project uses the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign) dataset, which is publicly available.
